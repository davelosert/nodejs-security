PURPOSE
=================
The Purpose of this Project is to build a and try all kinds of security measures for NodeJS-Apps.
The long-term goal could maybe be a Project-Boilerplate for a NodeJS-App that already covers most of the OWASP-Top-10
security risks by design.


CONTRIBUTING
=================
Everybody is welcome to contribute, show me flaws or errors. This is a learning Project with no real sense, so every
Feedback is welcome!


PLANS
=================
Since this gonna be a security-boilerplate for an WebApp, and since i think a WebApp defines itself by not rendering
Views serverside like "in the old days", I wanna build a dynamic AngularJS in the Frontend and handle all Data-Transfer via AJAX or
Websockets. Also, i want to implement a MongoDB with Mongoose to handle a User-Database and authentication system.


CREDITS & SOURCES
=================
I took and will take the security-measurments in this app from several pages, books, sites and so on...  Im just gonna List them here.
